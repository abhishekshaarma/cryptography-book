Asymptotic analysis studies algorithms by their time or space usage as a function of input size $n$, independent of hardware.

For example, sorting 10 elements with bubble sort might be as fast as merge sort, but on very large inputs (e.g., $500\times10^{12}$ elements), merge sort is much faster.


\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Big-O:} $T(n)=O(f(n))$ means there exist constants $c>0$ and $n_0$ such that for all $n\ge n_0$, 
  \[T(n)\le c\,f(n).\]
  \item \textbf{Big-\(\Omega\):} $T(n)=\Omega(f(n))$ means there exist constants $c>0$ and $n_0$ such that for all $n\ge n_0$, 
  \[T(n)\ge c\,f(n).\]
  \item \textbf{Big-\(\Theta\):} $T(n)=\Theta(f(n))$ means $T(n)=O(f(n))$ and $T(n)=\Omega(f(n))$, i.e., there exist constants $c_1,c_2>0$ and $n_0$ such that for all $n\ge n_0$, 
  \[c_1\,f(n)\le T(n)\le c_2\,f(n).\]
\end{itemize}
