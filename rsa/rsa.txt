RSA

RSA is one of most important encryption algorithm however we only work with intergers.
Since a message in its real form is just soem bits. we can viwe them as unsgiend int.

So, lets think of the mesaasges as intergers.

RSA works like this:

1.  Alice wants to send a message, that we call interger x, since M can be represented by number as we talked about before,

2. Bob selects two primes q and p and then computers N = pq

3. He then selects two postive integers e and d such that


                   ed is congreuent to 1 mod pi(B)

In other words e and d and multiplicative inverses of each other in Z/φ(N ).


4.Bob publishes N and e publicly. e is called the encryption
exponent and d is called the decryption exponent.


Here, the secret has to be less than an since we work  on Z/N.

5> Alice downlaord that n and e and rhen computes;
E(N,e) (x) = x^e (mod N )

When Bob received xe (mod N ), he computes
D(N,d) (x) = xed (mod N )

WHY RSA WORKS


To note :
It is a very interesting computing algorithm based on the computation time.
The p and q are very large prime. 
\begin{theorem}
Let $p, q$ be primes and $N = pq$. If $ed \equiv 1 \pmod{\phi(N)}$, then
$(x^e)^d \equiv x \pmod{N}$
for all integers $x$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Since $ed \equiv 1 \pmod{\phi(N)}$, there exists an integer $k$ such that $ed = 1 + k\phi(N)$.

We need to show that $(x^e)^d \equiv x \pmod{N}$ for all integers $x$.

There are two cases to consider:

\textbf{Case 1:} $\gcd(x, N) = 1$ (i.e., $x$ is coprime to $N$).

By Euler's theorem, we know that $x^{\phi(N)} \equiv 1 \pmod{N}$.

Therefore:
\begin{align*}
(x^e)^d &= x^{ed}\\
&= x^{1 + k\phi(N)}\\
&= x \cdot (x^{\phi(N)})^k\\
&\equiv x \cdot 1^k \pmod{N}\\
&\equiv x \pmod{N}
\end{align*}

\textbf{Case 2:} $\gcd(x, N) \neq 1$.

Since $N = pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are prime, $\gcd(x, N) \neq 1$ implies that either $p$ divides $x$ or $q$ divides $x$ (or both).

Suppose $p$ divides $x$. Then $x \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$, which means $x = pm$ for some integer $m$.

Therefore, $(x^e)^d \equiv 0^{ed} \equiv 0 \equiv x \pmod{p}$.

Now, if $\gcd(x, q) = 1$, then by Fermat's Little Theorem, $x^{q-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{q}$.

Since $\phi(N) = (p-1)(q-1)$, we have:
\begin{align*}
(x^e)^d &= x^{ed}\\
&= x^{1 + k\phi(N)}\\
&= x \cdot (x^{\phi(N)})^k\\
&= x \cdot (x^{(p-1)(q-1)})^k\\
&\equiv x \cdot (x^{q-1})^{(p-1)k} \pmod{q}\\
&\equiv x \cdot 1^{(p-1)k} \pmod{q}\\
&\equiv x \pmod{q}
\end{align*}


If $q$ also divides $x$, then $x \equiv 0 \pmod{q}$, and similarly $(x^e)^d \equiv 0 \equiv x \pmod{q}$.

By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since $(x^e)^d \equiv x \pmod{p}$ and $(x^e)^d \equiv x \pmod{q}$, we have $(x^e)^d \equiv x \pmod{N}$.

Therefore, $(x^e)^d \equiv x \pmod{N}$ for all integers $x$.
\end{proof}

\section*{Proposition 1.1.1}

\begin{proposition}
Prove the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] If $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes such that $p \mid a$ and $q \mid a$, then $pq \mid a$.
\item[(b)] If $x \mid a$ and $y \mid a$ and $\gcd(x, y) = 1$, then $xy \mid a$.
\item[(c)] If $x \mid a$ and $y \mid a$, then $(xy/ \gcd(x, y)) \mid a$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Since $p \mid a$, we have $a = pk$ for some integer $k$.
Since $q \mid a$, we have $q \mid pk$. Since $q$ is prime and $q \neq p$, $q$ does not divide $p$. Therefore, by Euclid's lemma, $q \mid k$.

So $k = qm$ for some integer $m$. Substituting, we get $a = p(qm) = (pq)m$.

Thus, $pq \mid a$.

\item[(b)] Since $x \mid a$, we have $a = xk$ for some integer $k$.
Since $y \mid a$, we have $y \mid xk$. Since $\gcd(x, y) = 1$, $x$ and $y$ have no common factors. Therefore, by Euclid's lemma, $y \mid k$.

So $k = ym$ for some integer $m$. Substituting, we get $a = x(ym) = (xy)m$.

Thus, $xy \mid a$.

\item[(c)] Let $g = \gcd(x, y)$. Then $x = gx'$ and $y = gy'$ where $\gcd(x', y') = 1$.

Since $x \mid a$, we have $a = xk = gx'k$ for some integer $k$.
Since $y \mid a$, we have $a = ym = gy'm$ for some integer $m$.

Therefore, $g \mid a$. Let $a = gn$ for some integer $n$.

Since $x' \mid n$ (because $gx'k = gn$ implies $x'k = n$) and $y' \mid n$ (because $gy'm = gn$ implies $y'm = n$) and $\gcd(x', y') = 1$, by part (b), we have $x'y' \mid n$.

So $n = x'y't$ for some integer $t$. Substituting, we get $a = gn = g(x'y't) = (gx'y')t = \frac{xy}{g}t$.

Thus, $\frac{xy}{g} \mid a$, which means $\frac{xy}{\gcd(x, y)} \mid a$.




We need to understand that RSA are not actaully used to encrypt strings but rather the different keys for the ciphers.
Lets say Bob wants to send a secret ,essage then he will make a cipher an dthen use it to encrypt the data, TThe key will be described as the binary sequence
of 26 × 8 = 208 bits.

Then Bob will use the encryt the key and then send to ALice and then bob can sent his M.

RSA and Public Key Cryptography
Why Public Key Cryptography is Used with Private Keys

Hybrid approach: Public key cryptography (like RSA) is used primarily to establish shared secret keys for symmetric encryption
Performance advantages:

Symmetric ciphers (like AES) are significantly faster than asymmetric ciphers (like RSA)
RSA is computationally intensive and unsuitable for large messages
AES can efficiently encrypt messages of any length


Practical implementation:

RSA encrypts the symmetric key (small data)
The symmetric key then encrypts the actual message (potentially large data)


Historical context: Earlier symmetric ciphers like 3DES are now deprecated (since 2018)
Current standard: AES is the modern symmetric cipher of choice
Technical limitation: The RSA standard (PKCS) doesn't include specifications for breaking up long messages

RSA Process Overview
1. Key Generation (By Bob)

Prime selection: Bob selects two distinct prime numbers p and q
Modulus calculation: Bob computes N = pq
Totient calculation: Bob computes φ(N) = (p-1)(q-1)
Public exponent selection: Bob chooses e such that:

0 < e < φ(N)
gcd(e, φ(N)) = 1


Private exponent calculation: Bob computes d such that ed ≡ 1 (mod φ(N))
Key distribution:

Public key (N, e) is published
Private key (N, d) is kept secret



2. Encryption (By Alice)

Key acquisition: Alice obtains Bob's public key (N, e)
Encryption formula: Alice computes E(N,e)(x) = x^e (mod N)
Transmission: Alice sends the encrypted message to Bob

3. Decryption (By Bob)

Private key usage: Bob uses his private key (N, d)
Decryption formula: Bob computes D(N,d)(x^e (mod N)) = x^ed (mod N) ≡ x (mod N)

Formal Definition of Public Key Cryptography

Key structure: A key k = (pubkey, privkey) is a 2-tuple consisting of:

Public key (known to everyone)
Private key (known only to the owner)


Functional definition: A public cipher consists of encryption and decryption functions:

Encryption function: E(pubkey)
Decryption function: D(privkey)


Alternate terminology: Public key cryptography is also called asymmetric key cryptography
Contrast with symmetric ciphers: In symmetric (private) key ciphers, the encryption and decryption keys are identical

This arrangement provides both the security benefits of public key cryptography and the performance benefits of symmetric encryption.
