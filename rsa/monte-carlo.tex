As noted earlier, Fermat and Miller--Rabin prime‐testing algorithms are probabilistic in the sense that:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If the return value is “$n$ is composite,” then you know for sure $n$ is composite.
  \item If the return value is “$n$ is probably prime,” then $n$ may be prime or composite.
\end{itemize}

Such tests are called \emph{Monte--Carlo algorithms} because their “prime” verdict is only probabilistic.  Since the “composite” verdict is always correct, they are sometimes called \emph{false‐biased} Monte--Carlo algorithms.

There are many primality tests; Miller--Rabin is just one.  A completely deterministic, polynomial‐time algorithm (the AKS test) was published in 2002 by Agrawal, Kayal, and Saxena, proving
\[
  \mathrm{Primes}\in P.
\]
However, AKS is not used in practice because its constants are large.  In real‐world use, testing a random 2048‐bit odd number with $t=10$ rounds of Miller--Rabin suffices.
